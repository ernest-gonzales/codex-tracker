# Media assets

Place README images in this folder and reference them from the root `README.md`.

Suggested filenames:
- `logo.png`
- `screenshot-dashboard.png`
- `screenshot-pricing.png`
- `screenshot-limits.png`

Notes:
- Keep images reasonably small (optimize PNGs) so clones stay fast.
- If you add more screenshots, prefer short, descriptive names (kebab-case).
